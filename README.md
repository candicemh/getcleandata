Coursera course in getting and cleaning data, including project

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The R code in run_analysis.R does the following (as per the project description)

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set (called mean_SD) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

A URL description of the data is available here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Data to replicate the analysis can be downloaded from here:
