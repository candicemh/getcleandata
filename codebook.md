This codebook describes data contained in the file "mean_SD.txt", which is the output of running the R code in "run_analysis.R".

A URL description of the data is available here:

There are 30 subjects (subjects_ID) who performed six activities (activity_labels) and had a series of measurements taken about their motion. The subjects were broken into a test and trial groups and data
about their motion stored in separate files.

These measurements were summised through a variety of summary statistics. The data is processed to remove all summaries that are not means or standard deviations. The resulting data is merged
into one data set (mean_SD) and written "mean_SD.txt".
